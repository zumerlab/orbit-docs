Orbit provides a comprehensive set of rules and visual aids in CSS to assist developers in enhancing user experience. These guidelines ensure adherence to best practices and optimize the utilization of Orbit's features.

### Checking browser support for `has()` CSS Rule

Before implementing features reliant on the `has()` CSS rule, it's essential to confirm browser compatibility. Orbit includes checks to verify support for this rule, alerting users if it's unavailable in the targeted browser environment.

### Checking browser support for `cos()` and  `sin()` trigonometric CSS functions

Orbit includes checks to verify support for these functions, alerting users if there are unavailable in the targeted browser environment.

### Visual Warning for Invalid Nested Elements

Orbit incorporates visual cues to identify and warn developers of invalid nested elements within orbit structures:

- **Invalid Child elements within `.gravity-spot`:** Orbit detects and notifies developers if `.gravity-spot` contains invalid direct child elements. Only  `.orbit-zoee`, and `.orbit` or `.orbit-*` elements are permissible within `.gravity-spot`.

- **Invalid Child elements within `.satellite`:** Similarly, Orbit checks for and alerts developers if `.satellite` includes invalid direct child elements. Only `.gravity-spot` elements are permitted within `.satellite`.


### Usage Limitation of `o-slice`, `o-text`, and `o-progress`

For optimal functionality, `o-slice`, `o-text`, and `o-progress` should only be applied within circular orbits. As Orbit currently doesn't support elliptical shapes for these web-components, they will be hidden if detected within incompatible orbit shapes.
